This Python script is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to change the Libadwaita theme on their system.

Here's a summary of its functionality:

    The script checks if the necessary directories (config and themes) exist. If not, it prompts the user to provide the correct directories.
    It lists all available themes in the themes directory and allows the user to select one from a dropdown menu.
    Once a theme is selected, the user can activate it by clicking the "Activate" button. This removes the previous theme and installs the new one by creating symbolic links to the theme's CSS and asset files.
    The script also has a settings menu that allows users to change the config and themes directories.
    If an error occurs during the theme activation process, an error message is displayed.

Overall, this script provides a simple and user-friendly way to manage Libadwaita themes on a system.
